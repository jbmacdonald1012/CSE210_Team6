# Hilo
---
Hilo is a game in which the player guesses if the next card drawn by the dealer 
will be higher or lower than the previous one. Points are won or lost based on 
whether or not the player guessed correctly.
If you guess the next card (higher or lower), you get 100 points. Otherwise, you 
lose 75 points. The game is over when you have less than 0 points. You can play 
again how many times you want.
